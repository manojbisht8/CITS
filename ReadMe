Steps to install the code:
Environment/IDE and Software:
	Eclipse JEE IDE
	Apache Tomcat (Version 8)
	MySql DB.

a)	DB Setup:
1)	Run the SQL script provided. (CITS_SQL_script.sql)

b)	Code/Workspace Setup:

2)	In Eclipse IDE, perform
File Menu  Import  Web  WAR File  WAR Import  Finish
A project (CITS_Project) will be created in Eclipse.
(As an alternative a new Dynamic web project can be created and the provided code “src” and WebContent” can replace the default/empty folders of the new project)

3)	To compile the code.
Project Menu  Clean  <Select Project>  Ok.
No compilation error should be reported.

4)	In case of any compilation errors due to missing JARs or if a new project is created instead of WAR import, we need to add external JARs.
Select the project  Right click  Properties  Java Build Path  Libraries Tab  Add External Jars  <Select the below jars provided with code>  Apply  Ok.
mysql-connector-java-5.1.31-bin.jar  (for JDBC connection to MySql DB).
servlet-api.jar    (for J2EE web project)
log4j-1.2.17.jar  (for logging)
gson-2.5.jar       (for AJAX call from UI)

5)	Configuration changes for DB and log file:
In src/Cits.properties change the DB_USER_NAME and DB_PASSWRD accordingly.
In src/log4j.xml change the log file path accordingly.

6)	Configure Tomcat server with Eclipse (if not already done).

7)	Add CITS_Project to Tomcat server in Eclipse.
Select Tomcat server  Right click  Add/Remove.

8)	Run the Project in Eclipse.
In CITS_Project, go to WebContent/jsp as select citsHome.jsp   Right click  Run As Run on server  <Select Tomcat 8>  Finish

9)	Copy the URL from Eclipse tab and run in Browser.
Say: < http://localhost:8080/CITS_Project/jsp/citsHome.jsp>
 
10)	For example in Google Chrome browser and perform various functions.
